        SMART DOCUMENT SUMMARIZATION & CURATION SYSTEM
                    Technical Architecture Report
================================================================================

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

This application is an offline, intelligent document summarization and curation 
system that processes multiple documents simultaneously to extract key insights, 
generate comprehensive summaries, and highlight important information. Built 
entirely with Python, it operates without requiring external APIs, making it 
ideal for secure, local document analysis.

The system supports 6 file formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT, RTF, ODT, Markdown), 
processes up to 5 files (max 50MB total), and delivers:
- Collective abstract across all documents
- Individual document summaries with bullet points
- Keyword extraction and visual highlighting
- Theme identification and analysis

================================================================================
2. CORE FUNCTIONALITY
================================================================================

2.1 Multi-Format Document Processing
------------------------------------
The application accepts and processes:
- PDF documents (.pdf) - Academic papers, reports, ebooks
- Word documents (.docx) - Business documents, articles
- Plain text (.txt) - Simple text files, transcripts
- Rich Text Format (.rtf) - Formatted text documents
- OpenDocument Text (.odt) - LibreOffice/OpenOffice documents  
- Markdown (.md) - Technical documentation, README files

WHY: Supporting multiple formats ensures users can process documents from any 
source without conversion, maximizing accessibility and usability.

2.2 Two-Tier Summarization Strategy
-----------------------------------
The system implements a dual-layer approach:

A) COLLECTIVE ABSTRACT
   - Combines insights from all uploaded documents
   - Identifies cross-document themes and patterns
   - Provides high-level overview in bullet-point format
   - Useful for understanding relationships between documents

B) INDIVIDUAL SUMMARIES
   - Document-specific key points extraction
   - Preserves unique insights from each source
   - Formatted as organized bullet points for readability
   - Includes metadata: word count, compression ratio

WHY: This approach balances breadth (collective view) with depth (individual 
details), giving users both macro and micro perspectives.

2.3 Intelligent Keyword Extraction
----------------------------------
Combines two complementary algorithms:
- TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
- TextRank (Graph-based ranking)

Results are merged and ranked to produce the most relevant keywords, which are:
- Visually highlighted in summaries with color-coded backgrounds
- Displayed as metrics for quick scanning
- Preserved in natural, readable language (not stemmed)

WHY: Dual algorithm approach ensures robust keyword identification - TF-IDF 
captures statistical importance while TextRank identifies contextual significance.

================================================================================
3. TECHNOLOGY STACK & ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS
================================================================================

3.1 Web Framework: Streamlit
----------------------------
WHAT: Python framework for building interactive web applications

WHY CHOSEN:
✓ Rapid development - Build UI with pure Python, no HTML/CSS/JS needed
✓ Built-in components - File upload, metrics, progress bars out-of-the-box
✓ Local hosting - Runs entirely offline on localhost:5000
✓ Reactive updates - Automatic UI refresh when data changes
✓ Session state management - Handles user data across interactions

ALTERNATIVES REJECTED:
✗ Flask/Django - Requires more frontend code, slower development
✗ Desktop GUI (Tkinter/PyQt) - Less modern interface, harder deployment

3.2 Document Parsing Libraries
------------------------------

A) PyPDF2 (PDF Processing)
WHAT: Pure Python PDF library for reading and extracting text
WHY: Lightweight, no external dependencies, works offline, handles most PDFs
LIMITATION: May struggle with scanned PDFs (would need OCR)

B) python-docx (Word Documents)
WHAT: Library for reading DOCX files (Office Open XML)
WHY: Direct access to Word document structure, extracts text and tables
NOTE: Only supports .docx format (Office 2007+), not legacy .doc files

C) striprtf (RTF Processing)
WHAT: Converts Rich Text Format to plain text
WHY: Simple, efficient RTF parser without heavy dependencies

D) odfpy (OpenDocument Format)
WHAT: Library for reading ODF files (ODT, ODS, ODP)
WHY: Supports open-source office formats used by LibreOffice/OpenOffice

E) markdown (Markdown Processing)
WHAT: Converts Markdown to HTML, then extracts text
WHY: Handles technical documentation format common in development

3.3 Natural Language Processing Stack
-------------------------------------

A) NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
WHAT: Comprehensive NLP library for text processing
WHY CHOSEN:
✓ Sentence tokenization - Accurately splits text into sentences
✓ Word tokenization - Breaks sentences into words
✓ Stopword filtering - Removes common words (the, and, is, etc.)
✓ POS tagging - Identifies parts of speech
✓ Well-established - Mature library with extensive documentation

COMPONENTS USED:
- punkt: Sentence boundary detection
- punkt_tab: Updated tokenizer models
- stopwords: Common word filtering (English)
- averaged_perceptron_tagger: Part-of-speech tagging
- wordnet: Lexical database for semantic relationships

B) spaCy (Advanced NLP)
WHAT: Industrial-strength NLP library
MODEL: en_core_web_sm (Small English model, 12MB)

WHY CHOSEN:
✓ Named Entity Recognition (NER) - Identifies people, organizations, locations
✓ Fast processing - Optimized for performance
✓ Linguistic features - Lemmatization, dependency parsing
✓ Small model size - Balances accuracy with download/storage requirements

WHEN USED:
- Entity extraction for identifying key concepts
- Text analysis and linguistic processing
- Fallback available if model not loaded (graceful degradation)

3.4 Machine Learning Libraries
------------------------------

A) scikit-learn (Text Analysis)
WHAT: Machine learning library for data analysis

COMPONENTS USED:

1) TfidfVectorizer
   WHAT: Converts text to TF-IDF feature vectors
   WHY: Identifies statistically important words across documents
   
   PARAMETERS:
   - max_features=1000: Limits vocabulary size for efficiency
   - ngram_range=(1,2): Captures both single words and word pairs
   - min_df=1: Keeps terms appearing in at least 1 document
   - max_df=0.8 (or 1.0 for single docs): Removes overly common terms
   - stop_words='english': Built-in stopword filtering
   
   ADAPTIVE BEHAVIOR:
   For single documents: max_df=1.0 (avoids TF-IDF warnings)
   For multiple documents: max_df=0.8 (filters common terms)

2) cosine_similarity
   WHAT: Measures similarity between text vectors
   WHY: Identifies sentences most representative of document themes
   USED IN: Sentence scoring for summary extraction

B) NetworkX (Graph Analysis)
WHAT: Library for creating and analyzing graph structures

WHY CHOSEN FOR TEXTRANK:
✓ Graph-based keyword extraction - Models text as word co-occurrence graph
✓ PageRank algorithm - Identifies important nodes (words) in network
✓ Context awareness - Captures word relationships beyond frequency

TEXTRANK PROCESS:
1. Create graph where nodes = words
2. Connect words that appear within 4-word window
3. Weight edges by co-occurrence frequency
4. Apply PageRank to rank words by importance
5. Return top-ranked words as keywords

WHY THIS MATTERS: TextRank captures semantic relationships that pure frequency 
analysis misses. Words that connect many other words gain importance.

================================================================================
4. ALGORITHM DEEP DIVE
================================================================================

4.1 Keyword Extraction Pipeline
-------------------------------

STAGE 1: TEXT PREPROCESSING
- Clean text: Remove URLs, emails, special characters
- Normalize whitespace and punctuation
- Preserve sentence structure for summarization
- NO STEMMING for keywords (preserves readability)

STAGE 2: TF-IDF EXTRACTION
Algorithm: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency
Formula: TF-IDF(word) = TF(word) × IDF(word)
Where:
- TF = (Number of times word appears in doc) / (Total words in doc)
- IDF = log(Total documents / Documents containing word)

WHY IT WORKS:
- High TF = Word is important to this document
- High IDF = Word is rare across documents (discriminative)
- TF-IDF = Balance between frequency and uniqueness

RESULT: Top 10 statistically significant terms per document

STAGE 3: TEXTRANK EXTRACTION
Algorithm: Graph-based ranking (similar to Google PageRank)
Process:
1. Tokenize text and filter stopwords
2. Build graph: words = nodes, co-occurrences = edges
3. Window size = 4 (words within 4-word distance are connected)
4. Edge weight = number of co-occurrences
5. Run PageRank algorithm to score nodes
6. Return top-scored words

WHY IT WORKS:
- Central words (connected to many others) rank higher
- Captures context and relationships
- Finds thematically important words, not just frequent ones

RESULT: Top 10 contextually significant terms per document

STAGE 4: KEYWORD FUSION
Combines TF-IDF and TextRank results:
- TF-IDF keywords: weight = 2 (statistical importance)
- TextRank keywords: weight = 1 (contextual importance)
- Global keywords (if present): weight += 1 (cross-document boost)
- Merge and rank by combined score

WHY COMBINE: Leverages strengths of both approaches
- TF-IDF: Finds statistically unusual/important words
- TextRank: Finds contextually central words
- Together: Comprehensive keyword coverage

RESULT: Top 8 keywords per document, Top 15 global keywords

4.2 Text Summarization Pipeline
-------------------------------

STAGE 1: SENTENCE EXTRACTION
- Tokenize text into sentences using NLTK punkt
- Filter out very short sentences (< 10 words)
- Preserve original order for coherent summaries

STAGE 2: MULTI-CRITERIA SENTENCE SCORING
Each sentence scored on 4 dimensions:

A) KEYWORD SCORE (40% weight)
   - Count keyword appearances in sentence
   - Bonus for keywords at sentence start
   - Normalize by sentence length
   - WHY: Sentences with keywords contain core concepts

B) POSITION SCORE (20% weight)
   - First sentence: 1.0 (often introduces topic)
   - Last sentence: 0.8 (often concludes/summarizes)
   - First 30% of sentences: 0.6 (early content important)
   - Other sentences: 0.4 (baseline importance)
   - WHY: Document structure provides importance signals

C) LENGTH SCORE (20% weight)
   - Prefer sentences close to average length
   - Score = 1.0 - |length - avg_length| / avg_length
   - Too short: May lack information
   - Too long: May be overly complex
   - WHY: Medium-length sentences balance information and clarity

D) SIMILARITY SCORE (20% weight)
   - Calculate TF-IDF vectors for all sentences
   - Compute centroid (average vector across sentences)
   - Score = cosine similarity to centroid
   - WHY: Sentences similar to document's main theme are important

FINAL SCORE = (0.4 × Keyword) + (0.2 × Position) + (0.2 × Length) + (0.2 × Similarity)

STAGE 3: SENTENCE SELECTION
- Calculate adaptive summary length:
  * For comprehensive coverage: 30-50% of total sentences
  * Minimum: 3 sentences
  * Maximum: Half of document sentences
- Select top-scoring sentences
- Maintain original document order (coherent flow)

STAGE 4: BULLET-POINT FORMATTING
- Format selected sentences as bullet points (• prefix)
- Preserve sentence boundaries and punctuation
- Enable easy scanning and readability
- WHY: Bullet format improves information absorption by 20-40%

RESULT: Comprehensive, readable summary covering key document points

4.3 Collective Abstract Generation
----------------------------------

PROCESS:
1. Extract individual summaries from all documents
2. Combine summaries into single text corpus
3. Re-tokenize into sentences
4. Filter sentences (minimum 20 characters)
5. Apply same multi-criteria scoring (with global keywords)
6. Select top 3-5 sentences
7. Format as bullet points

WHY THIS APPROACH:
- Summaries already contain key points from each document
- Re-summarizing summaries identifies cross-document themes
- Global keywords ensure coverage of shared concepts
- Bullet format highlights distinct insights

RESULT: Concise abstract capturing themes across all documents

4.4 Visual Highlighting System
------------------------------

ALGORITHM:
1. Escape HTML in text (security)
2. Sort keywords by length (longest first)
   WHY: Prevents partial matching ("machine" before "machine learning")
3. For each keyword:
   - Create case-insensitive regex pattern (\b word \b)
   - Replace with HTML span: <span style="background:color">word</span>
4. Cycle through 4 color schemes:
   - Primary: Yellow background (#ffeb3b)
   - Secondary: Blue background (#e3f2fd)
   - Accent: Purple background (#f3e5f5)
   - Success: Green background (#e8f5e8)

WHY MULTIPLE COLORS: Different colors for different keywords improve 
visual scanning and help users track specific concepts.

RESULT: Color-coded highlighted summaries for enhanced readability

================================================================================
5. PERFORMANCE & OPTIMIZATION
================================================================================

5.1 Processing Efficiency
-------------------------
- Maximum file size: 50MB total (prevents memory issues)
